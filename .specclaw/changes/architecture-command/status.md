## Progress

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Proposal | ✅ Approved | Approved by proceeding to `/specclaw:plan` |
| Spec | ✅ Complete | 11 FRs, 6 NFRs, 16 ACs |
| Design | ✅ Complete | Extends `specclaw-analyze-codebase`; 2 new files; 2 mechanical relocation edits |
| Tasks | ✅ Complete | 6 tasks, 3 waves |
| Build | ✅ Complete | 6/6 tasks complete, 0 failed. **No git operations performed** — no branch, no commits, no merge, per explicit operator instruction this session. All changes are uncommitted in the working tree on `specclaw/analyze-command`. |
| Verify | ✅ Passed |  |

## Task Progress

**Completed:** 6 / 6
**Failed:** 0

Wave 1 (parallel): T1 `dependency_graph` collector extension, T2 template +
`architecture-analyst` persona, T3 relocate `/specclaw:analyze`'s output
path — all complete. Wave 2: T4 orchestrating skill, T5 fixture +
parser-test case (Case 10, 8 new assertions) — complete. Wave 3: T6 README
rows + version bump (0.5.4 → 0.5.5) — complete.

Full parser suite: 56 passed, 0 failed (48 pre-existing + 8 new Case 10
assertions), verified independently after each wave.

## Agent Runs

| T2 | general-purpose | session default | ✅ complete | 139s |
| T3 | general-purpose | session default | ✅ complete | 151s |
| T4 | general-purpose | session default | ✅ complete | 87s |
| T5 | general-purpose | session default | ✅ complete | 726s |
| T6 | (orchestrator, no agent spawn — small mechanical edit) | — | ✅ complete | — |

## Issues

**Process deviation (intentional, operator-approved):** `specclaw-build`'s
normal `setup`/`commit`/`finalize` steps (branch creation, per-task commits,
merge-to-base) were skipped entirely this build. The operator's session-wide
"no git add/commit" instruction conflicted with the build skill's default
git-driven mechanics; asked to choose, the operator selected "implement
only, no git operations." Task status tracking (this file, `tasks.md`) still
updated normally via `specclaw-update-task-status` since that's file editing,
not a git operation.
