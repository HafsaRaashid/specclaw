## Progress

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Proposal | ✅ Approved | Approved by proceeding to `/specclaw:plan` |
| Spec | ✅ Complete | 16 FRs, 6 NFRs, 20 ACs |
| Design | ✅ Complete | New sibling script (delegates+merges); one agent, two documents |
| Tasks | ✅ Complete | 6 tasks, 4 waves |
| Build | ✅ Complete | 6/6 tasks complete, 0 failed. Normal specclaw flow — branch `specclaw/domain-command`, per-task commits. **Paused before `specclaw-build finalize`** (test run + merge to `main`) pending operator review, per this change's git-discipline note ("I review before merge"). |
| Verify | ✅ Passed |  |

## Task Progress

**Completed:** 6 / 6
**Failed:** 0

Wave 1 (parallel): T1 collector skeleton + UI-inventory extraction
(`.dfm`/`.xaml`/handler mapping/main-form hint), T2 templates +
`domain-analyst` persona — complete. Wave 2: T3 collector extension —
type/const/enum + business-rule candidates (depends on T1, same file,
sequenced not parallel) — complete, including two bugs found and fixed
during implementation (bash `\b` word-boundary not matching in this
environment; forward-declaration false-match on routine-body bounding).
Wave 3 (parallel): T4 orchestrating skill, T5 fixture + Case 11 parser
tests (19 new assertions) — complete. Wave 4: T6 README rows + version
bump (0.5.5 → 0.5.6) — complete.

Full parser suite: 75 passed, 0 failed (56 pre-existing + 19 new),
independently re-verified after every wave, not just trusted from agent
self-reports.

## Agent Runs

| Task | Agent | Model | Status | Duration |
|------|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| T1 | general-purpose | session default | ✅ complete | 1172s |
| T2 | general-purpose | session default | ✅ complete | 196s |
| T3 | general-purpose | session default | ✅ complete | 1159s |
| T4 | general-purpose | session default | ✅ complete | 37s |
| T5 | general-purpose | session default | ✅ complete | 2398s |
| T6 | (orchestrator, no agent spawn — small mechanical edit) | — | ✅ complete | — |

## Issues

**Awaiting operator decision:** `specclaw-build finalize` (runs
`build.test_command`/`lint_command`/`build_command` — all unconfigured for
this repo — then merges `specclaw/domain-command` into `main` via
`--no-ff`) has not been run. All six tasks are committed on the branch;
holding here for the operator to review (`git log`/`git diff main...`)
before the merge happens, per this change's explicit "Build-stage commits
... are fine ... I review before merge" instruction.
