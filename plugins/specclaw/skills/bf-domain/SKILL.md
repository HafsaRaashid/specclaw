description: Produce a domain and functional-spec view of an existing/legacy codebase — business entities, relationships, rules, and enumerations (domain-model.md) plus capabilities, workflows, UI inventory, and named gaps (functional-spec.md) — grounded in parsed forms (.dfm/.xaml), type/const declarations, and validation-routine candidates. Also proposes the module map (module-map.md): evidence-grouped MOD-### migration units — owned vs referenced-but-not-owned entities, rules, services, screens, and inter-module dependencies — that /specclaw:bf-rebuild-plan, /specclaw:bf-baseline, and /specclaw:bf-replay later use to migrate and accept a large legacy system one module at a time. The map is agent-proposed and human-confirmed; MOD-### ids are permanent and reconciled across regenerations, never renumbered. Works on any language or stack — Delphi/Object Pascal and .NET get first-class UI/form parsing, other stacks still get entities/rules/enumerations. Read-only: no TTY or credential prompts, no lifecycle gate. Use when you need to understand what a codebase's business domain actually is and what a user can do with it — onboarding, planning a refactor, or before proposing a change in an unfamiliar repo.

# specclaw bf-domain

**First, run** `specclaw-ensure-init .specclaw` — idempotently creates `.specclaw/` if it doesn't exist (silent if already initialized; auto-inits using the current directory's basename as the project name).

Analyze an existing codebase's business domain and user-facing functionality, writing `.specclaw/analysis/domain-model.md`, `.specclaw/analysis/functional-spec.md`, and `.specclaw/analysis/module-map.md`. Read-only side-command — no `specclaw-validate-change` call, no `<change>` involved, matching the `analyze`/`architecture`/`patterns`/`status` pattern.

1. **Resolve and collect:**
   ```bash
   specclaw-bf-domain-collect collect .specclaw [path]
   ```
   `[path]` defaults to the repository root when omitted. The script delegates to `specclaw-bf-analyze-codebase collect` for path validation, manifests, `dependency_graph`, and `discovered_docs`, then adds domain-specific facts (`forms`, `xaml_forms`, `other_ui_files`, `handler_implementations`, `main_form_hint`, `type_declarations`, `const_declarations`, `validation_routine_candidates`) plus `architecture_md` presence and the `module_map` block — the prior map's `status`, its `prior_modules[]` roster (id/name/status/owned entities/rules, ID-level facts only), and `next_mod_id`. `validation_routine_candidates` is a **hint list only**: a narrow `Valid*`/`Check*`/`Can*` naming heuristic, never an exhaustive inventory of business rules — an empty array means the heuristic matched nothing, never that the codebase has no rules (see the analyst's Candidate-Hint Rule). **If it exits non-zero, surface its stderr message to the user verbatim and stop** — don't retry, don't guess a different path. This validation already lives inside the delegated call to `specclaw-bf-analyze-codebase collect`; do not reimplement it here.

   **Run this step before Step 2's archive, and pass its JSON to the agent verbatim.** The `module_map.prior_modules[]` roster is read from the *live* `module-map.md`, which Step 2 is about to move — it is the only thing that lets the agent carry surviving `MOD-###` ids forward instead of renumbering them, and MOD ids are permanent.

2. **Archive all three prior documents, if they exist**, before writing new ones:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .specclaw/analysis/archive
   mv .specclaw/analysis/domain-model.md .specclaw/analysis/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)-domain-model.md
   mv .specclaw/analysis/functional-spec.md .specclaw/analysis/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)-functional-spec.md
   mv .specclaw/analysis/module-map.md .specclaw/analysis/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)-module-map.md
   ```
   Skip each `mv` independently if that specific file doesn't exist yet — one may exist without the others on an unusual prior run, and `module-map.md` is absent entirely on any project that predates the module hierarchy. This is the same shared archive directory `analyze`/`architecture` already use — all document types land in `.specclaw/analysis/archive/`, distinguished by filename.

3. **Spawn the analysis agent:** `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: "bf-domain-analyst"`, on the model from `config.yaml` `models.review` (default: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`). Pass as context:
   - The collected JSON (stdout of Step 1) — including `pending_questions`/`clarifications` presence + resolved paths for the agent's own Ask, Don't Guess de-duplication, and the `module_map`/`architecture_md` blocks for rubric row 9.
   - The resolved target path.

4. The agent writes `.specclaw/analysis/domain-model.md`, `.specclaw/analysis/functional-spec.md`, and `.specclaw/analysis/module-map.md` itself, per its own Output section — this skill does not write any of them.

5. **Present a short summary** to the user: the path analyzed, entity/rule/capability counts, and any Named Gaps the agent flagged.

6. **Relay the module map and ask the human to confirm it.** Report the module count with each module's name and owned-entity count, every cross-module reference the map recorded (an entity one module owns and another references — that is where a flow crosses a boundary), anything under `## Unassigned`, and **name every module or placement the agent marked `⚠ PROVISIONAL` together with its `PQ-NNN`**. Then state plainly that the map is **`PROPOSED`** and ask the user to review it and either confirm it — by editing its `**Status:**` line to `CONFIRMED by <name>, <YYYY-MM-DD>` — or tell you what to regroup.

   Say why the confirmation matters, in one sentence: `/specclaw:bf-rebuild-plan` sequences the migration from these boundaries, `/specclaw:bf-baseline` tags scenarios by them, and `/specclaw:bf-replay --module` accepts work by them, so a boundary nobody checked becomes the shape of the whole rebuild. Nothing is blocked by a `PROPOSED` map — every downstream command runs and reports that the map is unconfirmed — so present this as a review request, not a gate.

   If the agent raised any pending question this run, also mention that `/specclaw:bf-clarify` will type and number it (a contested boundary becomes a `DECISION` or `SCOPE` question with a permanent `CQ-###`), so the user knows where that conversation happens rather than answering it in chat where nothing records it.

7. **Show what comes next:**
   ```bash
   specclaw-bf-status .specclaw --next
   ```
   Render its output **verbatim**, after the summary and the confirmation request above — never instead of them. Read-only, writes nothing, costs a second.

   An unconfirmed map surfaces there as a **Next action**, because confirming it is an edit only a human can make. That is a review request, exactly as step 6 states, and never a gate: every downstream command runs against a `PROPOSED` map and reports that it is unconfirmed.

   **Only if this run completed.** Step 1 says to surface `collect`'s stderr and stop; that means stop. A run that did not finish must never print a next step, which would read as though the phase advanced when it did not.

   **Never work the next step out yourself.** `specclaw-bf-status` owns the lifecycle ordering for every `bf-*` command — which phase follows which, which open items are human work, and which command clears them. A next phase decided here would be a second copy of that ordering, diverging the moment either side changes.
