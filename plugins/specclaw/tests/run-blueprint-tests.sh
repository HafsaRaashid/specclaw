#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-blueprint-tests.sh — regression suite for the client options pack
# (/specclaw:bf-clarify --options-pack) and the target blueprint
# (/specclaw:bf-blueprint).
#
# What these two features share, and what this suite is really about:
#
#   BASH COMPUTES DECISION STATUS; NO AGENT EVER DOES. Both documents key
#   everything off whether a question is DECIDED / UNDECIDED / NOT-APPLICABLE.
#   That verdict is computed in bash from decisions.md's literal heading
#   structure plus clarifications.md's own `## Not Applicable` section, and
#   handed to the agents already resolved. If that computation is wrong, a
#   client is shown a question that was already answered, or — far worse — a
#   blueprint claims COMPLETE while resting on something nobody decided.
#
#   THE CITATION GATE. Every row of the blueprint's legacy->target mapping
#   table must cite the decision that sanctions it. A target element nobody
#   decided is precisely what that table exists to make impossible, so an
#   uncited row must FAIL the run rather than render.
#
# The tests that matter most are the three status-derivation ones (an empty
# `Decision:` line is not an answer; an Outstanding-Questions bullet is not an
# answer; a declared "not applicable" IS one) and the citation gate. Between
# them they are the whole trust model: everything else in both documents is
# presentation.
#
# ALSO REGRESSION-GUARDED HERE: the field-separator bug. The scan emits one
# record per question with several optionally-empty columns. A tab separator
# silently collapses runs of empties (a tab is IFS whitespace), shifting every
# later field left by a column — which an empty Type on a Not-Applicable entry
# produces every single time. That is not a hypothetical; it was the first bug
# these collectors had.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE CANNOT TEST, stated rather than implied: both commands are
# SKILLS — prose an agent follows — and the option text, the diagrams and the
# recommendations are agent-authored. No bash suite can prove an option is
# well-reasoned or a diagram is right. What is testable, and tested here, is
# every mechanical decision the bash side makes on the agent's output.
#
# Bash + coreutils only (no jq).
