#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-bootstrap-gate-tests.sh — regression suite for the target-foundation
# stage (templates/CONTRACT.md (n)):
#
#   - the propose gate: inert on a non-rebuild project, not-ready without a
#     manifest, and NAMING the command that fixes it
#   - "consumes decided architecture, never decides it": a required SQ that is
#     undecided is a loud stop naming the exact id, never a default
#   - an Outstanding-Questions bullet is not a decision; a declared
#     "not applicable" IS one
#   - the foundation-only gate: a scaffold carrying a BL capability is refused
#   - record's refusals, and that a failing record destroys nothing
#   - re-run on an existing foundation behaves as decided (no-op / gap-fill /
#     adopt-candidate), and never scaffolds over somebody's application
#   - the gate fails CLOSED on a manifest it cannot vouch for
#
# The two tests that matter most are the propose gate naming its command and
# the capability refusal. Between them they are the BL-010 incident: a
# screen-bearing item became responsible for inventing the app skeleton because
# nothing checked the skeleton existed, and nothing could have told the
# difference between a foundation and a foundation that had quietly grown a
# feature.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE CANNOT TEST, stated rather than implied: /specclaw:propose is
# a SKILL — prose an agent follows — so no bash suite can prove it actually
# stops. What is testable, and tested here, is the mechanical half it reads:
# foundation-check's verdict and the remedy string naming the command.
#
# Bash + coreutils + jq (the manifest and declaration are nested JSON).
