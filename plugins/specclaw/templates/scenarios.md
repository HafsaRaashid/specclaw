# Baseline Scenarios: {{title}}

  Every scenario carries:

  ### GM-NNN — <short title>

  - **Seam:** <from seams.md>
  - **Seam layer:** pure-function | service | http | persistence
  - **Modules:** <every MOD-### from module-map.md that OWNS one of the rules
    this scenario pins, comma-separated — or omitted entirely when
    module-map.md does not exist yet, exactly as "Verifies backlog item"
    reads "not yet backlog-linked" before rebuild-backlog.md exists>
  - **Business rules pinned:** <rule number(s) from domain-model.md, e.g. "rule 7">
  - **Arrange:** <state to set up>
  - **Act:** <call/action under test>
  - **Assert (shape):** <what the fixture must capture to prove the rule held>
  - **Kind:** boundary | edge case
  - **Verifies backlog item:** <rebuild-backlog.md item, or "not yet backlog-linked —
    rebuild-backlog.md does not exist yet">

  GM-NNN IDs are permanent, never renumbered — a captured fixture, a
  manifest entry and a module tag all hang off one, so a re-design that
  reassigned them would silently re-point every one of those without
  changing a single hash. specclaw-bf-baseline collect hands the design
  agent the PRIOR scenario roster (id, title, rules, modules, seam layer)
  for exactly this reason: surviving ids are carried forward by rule+title
  match, and only a genuinely new scenario takes the next free id. A
  scenario that is no longer designed becomes a tombstone

  ### GM-NNN — WITHDRAWN <date>, <reason>

  rather than disappearing, so its id stays claimed forever. Tombstones are
  skipped by `record` (they declare no seam layer and can never be captured)
  and by `harness-collect`, but they still count toward the next free id.

  Scenarios are derived directly from domain-model.md's documented rules;
  never invent a rule or a rationale the source document doesn't state.

  MODULES is the migration/acceptance dimension (MOD-### -> BL-0## ->
  DR-### -> GM-###). It is DERIVED, once, from module-map.md's own rule
  ownership — which module owns each DR-### this scenario pins — and copied
  verbatim thereafter, exactly like Seam layer: `record` extracts it into
  manifest.json and /specclaw:bf-replay --module joins on it there, never on
  this prose. Never re-derive it at record or replay time.

  A SCENARIO WHOSE RULES SPAN MODULES IS TAGGED WITH ALL OF THEM. That is
  required, not an edge case to round down: a multi-module scenario is the
  record of a flow that crosses a module boundary, it is selected by a
  --module run for EVERY module it names, and /specclaw:bf-replay's
  per-module rollup counts it toward each of them and states how many of a
  module's fixtures are shared. Tagging such a scenario with one module
  would make the other module's PASS a false verdict, and a module-scoped
  redesign would be able to retire another module's coverage without
  anyone noticing.

  `record` HARD-FAILS on a declared MOD-### that has no matching heading in
  module-map.md, on the same grounds as an unmapped error code: a module tag
  naming no module selects nothing, silently. It WARNS (never blocks) when a
  scenario's module disagrees with the module its own BL item is filed under
  in rebuild-backlog.md — one of the two documents is wrong, and bash does
  not decide which.

  SEAM LAYER is a closed enum (templates/CONTRACT.md (i)), copied from the
  seam's own declaration in seams.md — never re-derived from this scenario's
  prose. `specclaw-bf-baseline record` extracts it verbatim into
  manifest.json and HARD-FAILS on a missing or non-enum value; there is no
  default. It exists so /specclaw:bf-replay can enforce that the replay test
  exercises the rebuild at the same layer the fixture was captured at — a
  service-layer fixture replayed through HTTP measures transport and
  middleware, not the business rule this scenario pins.

  IDENTITY AND IDEMPOTENCY SCENARIOS (CONTRACT.md (k)): when the rule is
  about identity or idempotency, the Assert (shape) must name boolean
  ASSERTIONS the seam itself can answer — first_call_created,
  second_call_same_entity, second_call_created_duplicate — never a raw
  generated id. Two independently seeded databases never produce the same
  key, so comparing one is guaranteed noise and the rule goes unverified. A
  raw id recorded as evidence belongs in the fixture's normalized_fields, as
  a canonical path (CONTRACT.md (g)).

  A scenario the legacy app can never actually reach (no code path sets
  that state) does not belong here — list it under "No Legacy Behaviour
  Exists" instead, since there is no legacy behaviour to pin as a golden
  master.

  PROVISIONAL marker: when a scenario's pinned business rule is itself
  provisional (domain-model.md already marks it, or a clarifications.md CQ
  promoted from a PQ touches it), append
  `⚠ PROVISIONAL — pending PQ-NNN/CQ-NNN (proposed default: <x>)` to that
  scenario's own "Business rules pinned" line. This is soft-block — the
  scenario is still fully designed, just like any other; the Rule Coverage
  Check below groups these under their own "Provisional pending decision"
  heading. `specclaw-bf-baseline record` detects this literal marker text
  mechanically to set the matching manifest.json fixture entry's `status`
  to `PROVISIONAL` (see templates/CONTRACT.md) — never rename or reformat
  the marker string, or that detection silently stops working.
