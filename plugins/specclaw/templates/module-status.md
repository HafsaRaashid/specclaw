# Module Status: {{title}}

**Generated:** {{date}}
**Module map:** {{map_status}}

<!--
  A STATUS VIEW, NOT EVIDENCE — and the one document in .specclaw/ that is
  deliberately exempt from archive-then-replace.

  Every other generated document here is archived before being replaced,
  because each one is a finding someone may later need to cite: an analysis
  snapshot, a designed scenario, a recorded manifest, a replay verdict. This
  file is none of those. It contains no finding of its own — every number in
  it is recomputed, in full, from artifacts that ARE archived:

    module-map.md      the module roster, dependencies, and confirmation state
    rebuild-backlog.md each item's declared module and Gate state
    scenarios.md       which scenarios declare which module
    manifest.json      which of those scenarios have a captured fixture
    run-metadata.json  the verdict of each retained replay run
    pending-questions.md / clarifications.md  open questions naming a module

  So there is nothing here to preserve: an older copy would be a stale
  rendering of documents whose own history is already kept. Regenerating it
  wholesale every run is the correct behaviour, and archiving it would
  accumulate misleading near-duplicates of a view anyone can reproduce in a
  second. Nothing computes from this file, and no command reads it.

  It is READ-ONLY with respect to every input: it writes exactly one file
  and modifies nothing else.

  ── Column definitions, stated because "how many items" has more than one
  ── honest answer ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Backlog items (planned/total)
      planned = ACTIVE items declaring this module.
      total   = planned + that module's struck tombstones + its deferred
                items. So 8/11 means eight to build, three accounted for
                and deliberately not being built.
      Items with no usable **Module:** field are counted under Unassigned
      at the foot of the table, never distributed into a module by guesswork.

  Scenarios (captured/designed)
      designed = GM-### scenarios declaring this module, tombstones excluded
                 (a WITHDRAWN id is a claim on the id, not a scenario).
      captured = those with a fixture recorded in manifest.json.
      A scenario whose rules span modules is counted under EVERY module it
      declares — the same cross-module rule /specclaw:bf-replay applies — so
      these columns intentionally do not sum to the corpus total.

  Latest replay verdict
      The newest MODULE-SCOPED run (/specclaw:bf-replay --module MOD-###)
      that retained evidence, read from that run's own run-metadata.json.

      DELIBERATE LIMITATION: a change-scoped or --all run also exercises a
      module's fixtures, and its report carries a per-module rollup — but it
      records no per-module verdict in its metadata, so it cannot appear
      here. This column reads "no module-scoped run" in that case rather
      than borrowing a corpus verdict and presenting it as the module's own.
      Read that run's report's own Module Rollup section for it.

      A run invoked with --discard retained no evidence and is therefore
      invisible here, by design.

  Stub-tainted items
      How many of this module's items have a LATEST replay verdict that was
      earned while a dependency-bypass stub (templates/CONTRACT.md (m)) stood
      in for a module that is not built yet.

      LATEST is load-bearing. For each item, the newest retained run that
      COVERED it wins — so an item tainted in March and re-run clean in April
      counts as clean. Reading only "which runs were tainted" would keep
      reporting March forever.

      Unlike the verdict column, this counts runs at EVERY scope. A
      change-scoped run records no per-module verdict, but it does record
      exactly which items it exercised and which of those rested on a stub,
      and that is a per-item fact no scope distorts.

      An item consuming an ACTIVE stub that no run has ever exercised is NOT
      counted here — it has no verdict at all, tainted or otherwise. Those
      are named under the stub table instead, because "not yet checked" and
      "checked against a placeholder" are different states and collapsing
      them would overstate what has been verified.

      When this column is non-zero the verdict column reads PASS* rather
      than PASS. The two travel together so neither can be read alone.

  Quality remediation
      The **Quality state:** of this module's QUALITY-REMEDIATION backlog item,
      if it has one: BLOCKED (its functional items are not built yet, so there
      is nothing to measure), OPEN (measured and not yet within thresholds
      without regressing), or DONE.

      "—" means the module has no such item at all — the normal state of a
      project that has never run /specclaw:bf-quality, and a different thing
      entirely from an item that exists and has not passed.

      COMPUTED ELSEWHERE. The verdict is worked out in rebuild-backlog.md from
      .specclaw/analysis/quality-delta.json and is only READ here, like every
      other number in this view. It clears by re-measuring the target
      (/specclaw:bf-quality --target, then --compare), never by editing either
      document.

      This is the one column that can say a module is unfinished for a reason
      that has nothing to do with fixtures: a module whose every scenario
      PASSes can still be carrying an open remediation item, and it is not
      done.

  Open questions
      OPEN entries in pending-questions.md plus unanswered entries in
      clarifications.md whose text names this MOD-###. These are soft
      blocks: they never stop a command, they mark what is provisional.

  ── What this view does NOT claim ───────────────────────────────────────

  Nothing here says a module is "done". specclaw records no built state for
  a backlog item beyond a status note a human typed, so every number is a
  statement about planning, capture, and comparison coverage — not about
  completion. A module whose every fixture PASSed is a module whose recorded
  behaviour matched; it is not a module signed off.

  And a module showing PASS* has not even matched cleanly on its own terms:
  some of what it was compared against was a deliberate placeholder for a
  module nobody has built yet.

## Stubs In Effect By Module

<!--
  Every ACTIVE dependency-bypass stub, keyed by the module it FAKES — so
  "who is waiting on the real MOD-005?" is one lookup rather than a scan of
  every item's dependency list.

  Read the Consumed by column as the answer: those are the items already
  built against a placeholder for that module, whose verdicts carry an
  asterisk until it lands and they are re-replayed.

  ACTIVE only. A RETIRING entry is mid-verification and taints nothing; a
  RETIRED one is history. Both stay in module-stubs.md forever — the record
  that an item was built out of order outlives the stub — but neither is
  something anyone is still waiting on, which is what this table is for.

  The module an entry fakes is the MOD-### its Substitutes field names, or
  the module owning the BL item it names. Never inferred from anything else.

## Item Splits By Module

<!--
  Every ACTIVE or READY-TO-RESUME item split (templates/CONTRACT.md (o)),
  keyed by the module owning the item — so "which of this module's items are
  still missing a piece?" is one lookup.

  A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM THE STUB TABLE ABOVE, and the distinction is the
  whole reason both exist. A stub asks: was what this module was measured
  against real? A split asks: is this module's work even finished? A module
  can be entirely untainted — every verdict earned against real code — and
  still be carrying three items that are each missing a layer somebody
  deliberately deferred.

  ACTIVE and READY-TO-RESUME only. A COMPLETE split is history: its deferred
  scope was built and the full item passed a clean --item replay. The entry
  stays in item-splits.md forever, because the record that an item was built
  in halves outlives the split — but nobody is waiting on it, which is what
  this table is for.

  Nothing here taints anything and nothing here changes a verdict. What it
  changes is whether a reader can tell a finished module from one that looks
  finished.
